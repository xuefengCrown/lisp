You think you know when you learn, are more sure
when you can write, even more when you can teach,
but certain when you can program.
- Alan Perlis

One is certain of only what one builds.

You will never become proficient in a foreign language by studying vocabulary lists.
Rather, you must hear and speak (or read and write) the language to gain proficiency.
The same is true for learning computer languages.
